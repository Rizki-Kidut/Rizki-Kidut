Hello my name is Rizki Hidayat

I'm a Chemical Engineer. I love Technology FIeld.

Recently I've been interested in the Data Engineering Field.
So I began my journey in 2022 and joined the Digitalent Scholarship program in Data Engineering from the Indonesia Ministry of Communication and Informatics.
Then I built an End-to-end Data Pipeline Project, a guided project on Udemy
In 2023 I joined Digitalent Scholarship program again, but in AWS Academy Cloud Architecting

Now I'm in the process of completing my Data Engineer Professional Certificate on Coursera

I hope, I can switch career to Data Engineering soon.
